## Hardware
Items needed:
* Raspberry Pi (I'm using RPi 3)
* Pi camera
* RGB LED strip with 3 pins for RGB and 1 pin for 12v DC power. I'm using [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07QPN985K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) 5m LED strip.
* 3x N-channel MOSFETs. I'm using [these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0893WBH6H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
* Power supply for the LED strip. I'm using [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09H4NQNSL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) 12V 2A power supply.
* Male to female jack adapter connectors. I'm using [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0106GV3SU/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 5.5mm x 2.1mm connector.
* Breadboard
* Jumper wires (male-to-male, male-to-female)

## Hardware setup
Connect the LED strip to the Raspberry Pi as shown in the diagram below. The LED strip has 4 pins, 3 for RGB and 1 for 12v DC power. The 3 RGB pins are connected to the 3 MOSFETs, which are connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins. The 12v DC power jack is connected to the 12v DC power supply.

Also connect the Pi camera to the Raspberry Pi.

## Software setup
### Install required packages
Install the required packages with the following commands:
```bash
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Enable the camera
Enable the camera with the following command:
```bash
sudo raspi-config
```
Select `Interfacing Options`, then `P1 Camera`, then `Yes` and `Finish`. Reboot the Raspberry Pi with
```bash
sudo reboot
```
### Enable the pigpio daemon
The pigpio daemon is required to control the MOSFETs. Enable it with the following command:
```bash
sudo pigpiod
```
### Run the script
Run the script with the following command:
```bash
python lights.py
```

## Create launch script
Create a new file called `launch.sh` 
```bash
nano launch.sh
```
and add the following, replacing the path to the `lights.py` script with the correct path on your system.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Start the pigpio daemon
sudo pigpiod

# Run the lights.py script
python /home/pi/lights.py
```
Save and exit the file with `Ctrl+X`, `Y` and `Enter`. Now make the file executable with
```bash
chmod +x launch.sh
```
To run the script on startup, we need to add it to the `rc.local` file. Open it with
```bash
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```
Add the following line before the `exit 0` line, replacing the path to the `launch.sh` script with the correct path on your system. . The `&` at the end of the line will run the script in the background.
```bash
/home/pi/launch.sh &
```
Save and exit the file with `Ctrl+X`, `Y` and `Enter`. Now reboot the Raspberry Pi with
```bash
sudo reboot
```
Now `launch.sh` will run on startup and start the pigpio daemon and the `lights.py` script.
